I want it to work in the following way. The upload area and colours inside should be dull colours (use a little grey - to indicate that nothing has been selected yet). Once a file has been selected either by being dropped into the area or by selecting a file it should be checked if that file has the right extension provided as a string array; the user should be given immediate feed-back if it is the right file type by chaning colours on the area and providing a message to inform what the error is.

The upload button should trigger the upload to the server of the app. Please add user feedback for the upload, show the progress and do it in a stylish and modern way.

If something fails during upload provide feed-back by changing colours and a message.
